            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are various ways how forms of education are commonly subdivided
                into different types. The most common subdivision is between formal, non-formal, and informal
                education.[32][33][4][34] However, some theorists only distinguish between formal and informal
                education.[35] A process of teaching constitutes formal education if it happens in a complex
                institutionalized framework. Such frameworks are usually chronologically and hierarchically organized as
                in modern schooling systems, which have different classes based on the student's age and progress, all
                the way from primary school to university. Because of its scale, formal education is usually controlled
                and guided by a governmental entity and is normally compulsory up to a certain age.[32][36] Non-formal
                and informal education differ from formal education due to their lack of such a governmental
                institutionalized framework. Non-formal education constitutes a middle ground in the sense that it is
                also organized, systematic, and carried out with a clear purpose in mind, such as tutoring, fitness
                classes, or the scouting movement.[32][36][4] Informal education, on the other hand, happens in an
                unsystematic way through daily experiences and exposure to the environment. Unlike formal and non-formal
                education.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education designed to support early development in preparation for
                participation in school and society. The programmes are designed for children below the age of three.
                This is ISCED level 01.[56] Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven,
                depending on the country when children enter primary education. The children now readily interact with
                their peers and the educator.[56] These are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in
                the US, where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of primary education.[58] Kindergarten
                "provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at
                unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of
                them."[59] This is ISCED level.</p>
